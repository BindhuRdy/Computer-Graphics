-----Instructions to run the code ----------
-Unzip the code folder and save it any where on your machine.

Testing Dual and polycord detection
-Open testcases directory
-Open Hand folder
-Run the exe file in that folder
- use key ‘m’ to toggle of show/hide of mesh
- use key ‘d’ to toggle of show/hide of dual mesh
- use key ‘c’ to toggle of show/hide of poly chords 
- use key ‘x’ to Zoom Out the view
- use key ‘z’ to Zoom In  the view

Testing Models
-Open testcases directory
-Open Bunny/Rampant folder
-Run the exe files in that folder
- use key ‘m’ to toggle of show/hide of mesh
- use key ‘d’ to toggle of show/hide of dual mesh 
- use key ‘x’ to Zoom Out the view
- use key ‘z’ to Zoom In  the view

Note: These models are the output meshes and it is observed that it takes some time to load the mesh
once exe file is ran.

Testing from code(Assuming opengl setup is ready with all libraries available for use)
-Copy the project src folder into a new project in your work space.
-Copy the mesh ply files to project directory
-Set the run configurations to main.cpp file as mesh file name(example hand.ply)
-Run to see the mesh loaded on scree and use the same keys as mentioned in the above steps.
